/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<li>DataTables is a plug-in for the jQuery Javascript library. It has a great <a href="https://datatables.net/manual/">documentation</a>, and a large set of <a href="https://datatables.net/examples/index">examples</a>.</li>
<li>The R package <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/DT/">DT</a> uses <a href="https://datatables.net/">datatables.net</a> as the underlying library for both R notebooks and Shiny applications. In addition to the standard functionalities of the library (display, sort, filtering and row selection), RStudio seems to have implemented cell edition.</li>
<li>Marek Cermak has an interesting <a href="https://medium.com/@marekermk/guide-to-interactive-pandas-dataframe-representation-485acae02946">tutorial</a> on how to use datatables within Jupyter. He also published <a href="https://github.com/CermakM/jupyter-datatables">jupyter-datatables</a>, with a focus on numerical data and distribution plots.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Alternatives">Alternatives<a class="anchor-link" href="#Alternatives">&#182;</a></h2><p>ITables uses basic Javascript, and because of this it will only work in Jupyter Notebook, not in JupyterLab. It is not a Jupyter widget, which means that it does not allows you to <strong>edit</strong> the content of the dataframe.</p>
<p>If you are looking for Jupyter widgets, have a look at</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>If you are looking for a table component that will fit in Dash applications, see <a href="https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/">datatable by Dash</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Contributing">Contributing<a class="anchor-link" href="#Contributing">&#182;</a></h2><p>I think it would be very helpful to have an identical table component for both Jupyter and <a href="http://dash.plot.ly/">Dash</a>. Please <a href="https://community.plot.ly/t/why-does-dash-have-its-own-datatable-library/">let us know</a> if you are interested in drafting a new table component based on an existing Javascript library for Dash.</p>
<p>Also, if you happen to prefer another Javascript table library (say, <a href="https://www.ag-grid.com/">ag-grid</a>), and you would like to see it supported in <code>itables</code>, please open either an issue or a PR, and let us know what is the minimal code to display a table in Jupyter using your library.</p>
